# Disaster Recovery Checklist

- DNS
  - Confirm registrar access.
  - Recreate CNAME for `www.simiriki.com` → SWA default hostname.
  - Validate with `nslookup www.simiriki.com`.
- Static Web App (SWA)
  - If missing, recreate SWA and reconnect to GitHub branch `main`.
  - Redeploy artifacts (rerun latest successful deploy workflow).
- Storage
  - Restore `reports` and `leads-raw` from backups.
  - Use `scripts/backup-reports.sh` to rehydrate locally if needed.
- Function App
  - Recreate `func-simiriki-leadscore` and deploy via `make deploy-func`.
  - Set `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` and Function host keys.
- Secrets & Config
  - Validate app settings for SWA and Function (Stripe keys, connection strings).
  - If using Key Vault, re-link access policies and references.
- Monitoring & Alerts
  - Verify Application Insights is connected and alerts are active.
- Validation
  - Run uptime workflow manually.
  - Seed 1–2 test leads with `scripts/seed-leads.sh`.
